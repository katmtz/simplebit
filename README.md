FitBit Passport Example
========================

An example app implementing Fitbit OAuth with Passport.js.

## Getting Started

To bring your own remix to life, you'll need to visit Fitbit's [app registration](https://dev.fitbit.com/apps/new) page to create a new oauth app, and use `https://{your-remix}.glitch.me/auth/fitbit/callback` as the Authorization callback URL.  Once you've done this, place the resulting ClientID and ClientSecret into the `.env` file. 

## View the Code

On the back-end,
- the app starts at `server.js`
- frameworks and packages are in `package.json`
- app secrets are safely stored in `.env`

On the front-end,
- edit `index.html` and `success.html`
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project
